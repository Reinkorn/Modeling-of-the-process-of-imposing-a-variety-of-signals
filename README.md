# Modeling-of-the-process-of-imposing-a-variety-of-signals
This task presents a program for modeling the process of imposing external amplitude modulation.
The amplitude and amplitude2a files contain experimental samples of amplitude measurements.
In the file ksi.txt experimental values of the signal phase samples are recorded.
